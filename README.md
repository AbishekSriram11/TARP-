## Problem Statement
Generally every house has underground and overhead tanks.
Water to underground tanks are supplied periodically and pumped to overhead tanks using electric motors.
This electric motors are inefficiently used resulting in higher power consumption and high maintenance cost.
Also there is no tracking of water usage in a lot of homes, other than a monthly water bill. 
Adding to this, there is a lack of data generated on water consumption for study or
data analysis on some of the usage patterns and water consumption overall.
Having day to day water consumption data will  help us in analyzing the water usage 
patterns and also create awareness on water consumption at home level.
